This is the codebase for the new version of my personal website, made in next.js (the old one was made in React)

## Why Next.js?
Because the SEO of a React website is **complete shit**

## Old website
The old website codebase can be found on https://github.com/danielbergholz/bergdaniel.com.br, and the live version on https://bergdaniel.netlify.app/
